# Design patterns in JavaScript / TypeScript

**Note** JavaScript (TypeScript) is a functional programming language. Most of the design patterns implemented in this repo are for OOP Languages (think Java, C++). It is recommended to research if there're other simpler solutions to a specific problem before relying on any OOP pattern.

*IMHO*, it's still a good idea to learn these patterns as it indirectly teaches devs to think in specific design pattern constructs (even if they end up being a single line of code).
